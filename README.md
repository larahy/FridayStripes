FridayStripes
=============

This application was built in Sinatra and used Ruby, HTML and CSS.

I wanted to use the same logic used to build the Sodoku grid to create a simple page to showcase photographs of #fridaystripes from Instagram.  
Initially the image url's were had coded but several weeks later I learnt to use the Instagram API to scrape the images with that hashtag.
The website is still unfinished but I practised used this as a test to point to a host other than Heroku using DNS settings -- see it at www.fridaystripes.co.uk
